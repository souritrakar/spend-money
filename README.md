"Spend" Jeff Bezos' money is a web app which simulates spending of billionaire Jeff Bezos' money, on a variety of items, whose prices increase as you go left to right. You can buy or sell items, and after you're done spending the money, a custom transaction receipt/invoice is generated below, which you can download on your computer.

This application is made with React.js, React Context API, and Material UI. There are some minor UI issues regarding responsiveness on devices, and I will fix them as soon as possible.
